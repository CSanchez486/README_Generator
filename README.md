# README_Generator
 

## Description

The ReadMe Generator prompts questions on the different sections of a markdown file that will be used as a ReadMe for that project. The generator compiles all the responses and creates a markdown file titled 'newReadMe.md'. This file is saved in the Develop folder after it is generated. 

## Usage

The ReadMe Generator can be used to create concise markdown files.
